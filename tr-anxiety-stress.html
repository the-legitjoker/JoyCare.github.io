      <h1 class="title"> Treatment for Anxiety and Stress </h1><br>
      <ul>
        <p>Congnitive-Behavioral Therapy</p><br>
        <li>This type of psychotherapy seeks to identify and alter negative thinking patterns that underpin nervous and troubling emotions. CBT practitioners hope that by doing so, they will be able to reduce distorted thinking and change how people respond to stimuli or events that cause anxiety.</li><br>
        <li>A psychotherapist delivering CBT for panic disorder, for example, would continue to emphasize that panic attacks are not the same as heart attacks. CBT can include exposure to fears and causes. This teaches people to face their fears and helps them become less sensitive to their anxiety causes.</li><br>
        <p>Medications - A person can support anxiety management with several types of medication.</p><br>
        <li>Benzodiazepines - These can be prescribed by a doctor for some people who suffer from anxiety, but they can be very addictive. Except for drowsiness and the potential for addiction, these medications have few side effects. Diazepam, also known as Valium, is a popularly prescribed benzodiazepine.</li><br>
        <li>Antidepressants - These are widely used to treat anxiety, but they can also be used to treat depression. People sometimes take serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which have less side effects than older antidepressants but can cause jitters, nausea, and sexual dysfunction when first started.</li><br>
        <li>Fenfluramine (Prozac) and citalopram (Celexa) are two other antidepressants.</li><br>
      </ul><br>
      <h1 class="title"> Self-Remedies </h1><br>
      <ul>
        <p>In certain cases, an anxiety disorder may be treated at home without the need for professional supervision. However, for serious or long-term anxiety disorders, this may not be successful.</p>
        <p>Stress-management</p><br>
        <li>Learning to handle stress can help to reduce the number of possible causes. Organize any pending deadlines and demands, make lists to make challenging activities more manageable, and schedule time off from school or work.</li><br>
        <p>Relaxation Techniques</p><br>
        <li>Simple exercises can help alleviate anxiety's mental and physical symptoms. Meditation, deep breathing exercises, long baths, resting in the dark, and yoga are some of these methods.</li><br>
        <p>Exercises to replace negative thoughts with positive ones</p><br>
        <li>Make a list of the negative thoughts that are likely to cycle as a result of anxiety, and next to it, make a list of constructive, believable thoughts to replace them.</li><br>
        <li>If anxiety symptoms are related to a particular cause, such as a phobia, creating a mental picture of successfully overcoming and conquering the fear can be beneficial.</li><br>
      </ul><br>
      <h1 class="title"> Ways to reduce risk of anxiety disorders </h1><br>
      <ul>
        <p>Remember that nervous thoughts are a normal part of life, and that having them does not necessarily mean you have a mental health problem.</p><br>
        <li>Caffeine, tea, cola, and chocolate can all be avoided.</li><br>
        <li>Check with a doctor or pharmacist before using over-the-counter (OTC) or natural treatments for any chemicals that could exacerbate anxiety symptoms.</li><br>
        <li>Maintain a nutritious diet.</li><br>
        <li>Maintain a daily sleeping schedule.</li><br>
        <li>Alcohol, cannabis, and other recreational substances should be avoided.</li><br>
      </ul><br>
      <h1 class="title"> Behavioral symptoms of anxiety </h1><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Inability to remain calm</li><br>
        <li>Trouble sleeping</li><br>
        <li>Ritualistic behaviors, such as washing hands repeatedly</li><br><br><br>
      </ul>
