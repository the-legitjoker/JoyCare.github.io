        <p> Anxiety Attacks </p><br>
        <li> An anxiety attack is characterized by a strong sense of dread, concern, depression, or fear. An anxiety attack can take a long time to develop for many people. When a stressful situation approaches, it can get worse.</li><br>
        <li> Anxiety attacks may manifest in a variety of ways, and symptoms can differ from person to person. That's because anxiety's various symptoms don't affect everyone, and they can evolve over time.</li><br>

      <h1 class="title"> Anxiety and Stress </h1><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Anxiety is a common and beneficial emotion. When an individual experiences disproportionate amounts of anxiety on a regular basis, however, it can become a medical condition.</li><br>
        <li>It's normal to experience some anxiety. If you have to deal with a problem at work, go to an interview, take an exam, or make a major decision, you might feel anxious or nervous. Anxiety, on the other hand, may be helpful. Anxiety, for example, aids us in recognizing risky circumstances and focusing our attention, allowing us to remain healthy. But an anxiety disorder goes beyond the regular nervousness and slight fear you may feel from time to time.</li><br>
      </ul>
      <h1 class="title"> Causes Of Addiction </h1><br>
      <ul>
        <p>Anxiety disorders are similar to other types of mental illness in that they are characterized by a lack of control over one's emotions. They are not the result of personal shortcomings, character flaws, or upbringing issues. However, no one knows for sure what causes anxiety disorders. They believe a number of factors are at play:</p><br>
        <li>Chemical imbalance: Prolonged or severe stress may alter the chemical balance that regulates your mood. An anxiety disorder can develop when a person is exposed to a lot of stress over a long period of time.</li><br>
        <li>Environmental factors: A traumatic event can set off an anxiety disorder, particularly in someone who has a genetic predisposition to develop one.</li><br>
      <h1 class="title"> External factors that lead to anxiety and stress </h1><br>
      <li>Stress at work</li><br>
      <li>Stress from schoo</li><br>
      <li>Stress in a personal relationship such as marriage</li><br>
      <li>Financial stress</li><br>
      <li>Stress from unpredictable or uncertain world events, like a pandemic”</li><br>
      <li>Stress from an emotional trauma such as the death of a loved one</li><br>
      <li>Use of an illicit drug, such as cocaine</li><br>
      <h1 class="title"> Types of anxiety and stress</h1><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a long-term anxiety disorder characterized by worries about nonspecific life events, things, and circumstances. GAD is the most common anxiety condition, and sufferers aren't often able to pinpoint the source of their anxiety.</li><br>
        <li>Panic disorder is characterized by brief or unexpected attacks of extreme fear and anxiety. These attacks can cause trembling, confusion, dizziness, nausea, and difficulty breathing. Panic attacks usually start and intensify quickly, reaching a peak after 10 minutes. A panic attack, on the other hand, can last for hours. Panic disorders are most often triggered by frightening events or prolonged stress, but they may also strike without warning.
          When someone has a panic attack, they will mistake it as a life-threatening illness and make dramatic behavioral adjustments to prevent future attacks.</li><br>
        <li>Phobias are irrational fears of specific circumstances or things. Some of these fears, such as a fear of snakes, are understandable. However, the level of fear often does not correspond to the situation. You can spend a lot of time trying to avoid circumstances that may cause the phobia, just as you would for other anxiety disorders.</li><br>
        <li>Environmental stressors, such as work-related challenges, relationship problems, or family issues biology.</li><br>
        <li>Anxiety disorders run in families, so people who have a family member with one are more likely to develop one themselves.</li><br>
        <li>Medical considerations, such as the symptoms of another illness, the side effects of a drug, or the stress of a major operation or a lengthy recovery period.</li><br>
      </ul>
