        <p><strong>Causes of Mental Illnesses</strong></p><br>
        <li>Mental disorders are believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors in general:</li><br>
        <li>Inherited Traits - Inherited traits. Mental illness is more common in people whose blood relatives also have a mental illness. Certain genes may increase your risk of developing a mental illness, and your life situation may trigger it.</li><br>
        <li>Environmental exposures before birth - Prenatal exposure to the environment. Environmental stressors, inflammatory factors, chemicals, alcohol, and medications may all be related to mental illness while in the womb.</li><br>
        <li>Brain chemistry - The chemistry of the brain. Neurotransmitters are brain chemicals that bring messages to other parts of the brain and body. The role of nerve receptors and nerve systems changes as neural networks containing these chemicals are disrupted, leading to depression and other emotional disorders.</li><br>
