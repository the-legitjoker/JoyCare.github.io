        <p>Essential oils</p>

        <li>Bergamot - Bergamot: This citrusy essential oil has been shown to help patients who are about to undergo surgery feel less anxious. Individuals who suffer from anxiety as a result of depression can benefit from the same benefit, although there is no evidence to back this up.</li><br>
        <p>Vitamins</p>
        <li>Vitamin B12 and B-16 - B-12 and B-6 vitamins are important for brain health. When your vitamin B levels are poor, you're more likely to experience depression.</li><br>

        <li> Become a member of a youth-serving group. Adolescent-specific services may assist in the development of new interests. </li><br>
        <li> Seek assistance from a responsible adult. When issues become too much for a teen to tackle alone, he or she should not be afraid to seek assistance.</li><br>
